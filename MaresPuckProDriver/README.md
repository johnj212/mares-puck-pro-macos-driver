# DRAFT - Mares Puck Pro Driver for macOS

A native macOS application for communicating with the Mares Puck Pro dive computer. Working progress....

## Features

- üåä **Native macOS App** - Built with SwiftUI for modern macOS experience
- üîå **USB Communication** - Connects via USB-to-serial interface
- üìä **Dive Data Download** - Retrieve dive logs from your Puck Pro
- üìà **Dive Analysis** - View detailed dive profiles and statistics
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Communication** - Careful RTS/DTR control prevents device reboots

## System Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Mares Puck Pro dive computer
- Official Mares USB interface cable (CP210x based)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Install CP210x Driver** (usually pre-installed on modern macOS):
   - The Silicon Labs CP210x USB-to-UART bridge driver
   - Download from [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) if needed

2. **Xcode or Swift Development Tools** (for building from source):
   - Xcode 15.0 or later
   - Swift 5.9 or later

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd MaresPuckProDriver
   ```

2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift run MaresPuckProDriverApp
   ```

   Or open `Package.swift` in Xcode and run the project.

## Usage

### Connecting Your Puck Pro

1. **Prepare the Device**:
   - Ensure your Puck Pro is on and in surface mode
   - The display should show "PC ready" or similar
   - Connect the official Mares USB cable

2. **Connect in the App**:
   - Launch the Mares Puck Pro Driver app
   - Click "Refresh Ports" to scan for devices
   - Select your device from the port list (usually contains "usbserial")
   - Click "Connect"

3. **Download Dive Data**:
   - Once connected, click "Download Dives"
   - The app will communicate with your Puck Pro and retrieve dive logs
   - View detailed dive information including profiles and statistics

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If the device reboots during connection:

1. **Check USB Cable**: Ensure you're using the official Mares interface cable
2. **Device Mode**: Verify the Puck Pro shows "PC ready"
3. **Driver Installation**: Confirm CP210x drivers are installed
4. **Port Selection**: Try different available serial ports

## Technical Details

This driver implements the Mares IconHD protocol based on analysis of the libdivecomputer project. Key technical aspects:

- **Protocol**: Uses Mares IconHD command structure with XOR encoding
- **Communication**: 9600 baud, 8N1, with careful RTS/DTR control
- **Safety**: Prevents device reboots through proper line control
- **Framework**: Built with ORSSerialPort for reliable serial communication

### Protocol Structure

Commands use the format: `[CMD, CMD^0xA5]`
Responses follow: `[0xAA, ...data..., 0xEA]`

Example:
- Version command: `[0xC2, 0x67]`
- Expected response: `[0xAA, version_data, 0xEA]`
