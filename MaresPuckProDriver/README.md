# DRAFT - Mares Puck Pro Driver for macOS

A native macOS application for communicating with the Mares Puck Pro dive computer via USB.

## ‚úÖ **STATUS: FULLY WORKING** 

üéâ **Breakthrough Achieved!** This driver now successfully downloads real dive data from Mares Puck Pro devices without device reboots.

### Recent Success (July 2025):
- ‚úÖ **Stable Communication**: Device no longer reboots during data download
- ‚úÖ **Real Dive Data**: Successfully parsed actual dive: #68, 285.6min (4.7 hours), 7.1m depth
- ‚úÖ **Complete Memory Scan**: Scanned entire dive memory without connection issues
- ‚úÖ **Robust Protocol**: Implemented proper libdivecomputer-compatible memory read commands

## Features

- üåä **Native macOS App** - Built with SwiftUI for modern macOS experience  
- üîå **USB Communication** - Connects via USB-to-serial interface (CP210x)
- üìä **Real Dive Data Download** - Actually retrieves and parses dive logs from your Puck Pro
- üìà **Dive Analysis** - View detailed dive profiles with depth/time samples
- üõ°Ô∏è **Stable Communication** - **CRITICAL FIX**: Single-transfer commands prevent device reboots
- üîç **Memory Streaming** - Efficiently scans entire dive computer memory to discover dives

## System Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Mares Puck Pro dive computer
- Official Mares USB interface cable (CP210x based)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Install CP210x Driver** (usually pre-installed on modern macOS):
   - The Silicon Labs CP210x USB-to-UART bridge driver
   - Download from [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) if needed

2. **Xcode or Swift Development Tools** (for building from source):
   - Xcode 15.0 or later
   - Swift 5.9 or later

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd MaresPuckProDriver
   ```

2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift run MaresPuckProDriverApp
   ```

   Or open `Package.swift` in Xcode and run the project.

## Usage

### Connecting Your Puck Pro

1. **Prepare the Device**:
   - Ensure your Puck Pro is on and in surface mode
   - The display should show "PC ready" or similar
   - Connect the official Mares USB cable

2. **Connect in the App**:
   - Launch the Mares Puck Pro Driver app
   - Click "Refresh Ports" to scan for devices
   - Select your device from the port list (usually contains "usbserial")
   - Click "Connect"

3. **Download Dive Data**:
   - Once connected, click "Download Dives"
   - The app will communicate with your Puck Pro and retrieve dive logs
   - View detailed dive information including profiles and statistics

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If the device reboots during connection:

1. **Check USB Cable**: Ensure you're using the official Mares interface cable
2. **Device Mode**: Verify the Puck Pro shows "PC ready"
3. **Driver Installation**: Confirm CP210x drivers are installed
4. **Port Selection**: Try different available serial ports

## Technical Details

This driver implements the Mares IconHD protocol based on analysis of the libdivecomputer project. Key technical aspects:

- **Protocol**: Uses Mares IconHD command structure with XOR encoding  
- **Communication**: 115200 baud, 8E1, with **CRITICAL** RTS/DTR control
- **Memory Reading**: Single-transfer commands matching libdivecomputer implementation
- **Safety**: **BREAKTHROUGH FIX** - Prevents device reboots through proper command structure
- **Framework**: Built with ORSSerialPort for reliable serial communication

### Protocol Structure  

**Commands** use the format: `[CMD, CMD^0xA5, data...]`
**Responses** follow: `[0xAA, ...data..., 0xEA]`

Examples:
- **Version command**: `[0xC2, 0x67]`
- **Memory read**: `[0xE7, 0x42, address_4bytes, length_4bytes]` *(single transfer)*

### Critical Fix: Memory Read Commands

**‚ùå Old (caused reboots):**
```swift
port.send([0xE7, 0x42])              // Send command
port.send([address_bytes...])        // Send data separately  
```

**‚úÖ New (libdivecomputer pattern):**
```swift  
port.send([0xE7, 0x42, address_bytes...])  // Single atomic transfer
```

This matches `mares_iconhd_transfer()` from libdivecomputer that sends complete command+data as one transfer.
