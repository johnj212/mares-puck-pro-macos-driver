Communication Protocol Analysis:

Initial Setup:
•  Line 11: INFO: Write: size=2, data=C267 - Initial handshake command
•  Line 12: INFO: Read: size=1, data=AA - Acknowledgment from Puck Pro
•  Line 13: Device info response (140 bytes) containing "Puck Pro" identifier

Data Exchange Pattern:
1. Write command (2 or 8 bytes) 
2. Read acknowledgment (AA)
3. Write data request (8 bytes with memory address)
4. Read data block (256 bytes typically)  
5. Read end marker (EA)

Key Commands Logged:
•  C267 - Initial handshake
•  E742 - Data request command
•  0C00000004000000 - Read device info
•  C812010000010000 - Read memory block at address 0x0112C8

Memory Reading:
The dive computer memory is read in 256-byte blocks sequentially:
•  Each block starts with E742 command
•  Memory addresses increment: C812, C811, C810, etc.
•  Data contains dive profiles, timestamps, depth readings

Serial Communication Settings:
•  Baud rate: 115200
•  Data bits: 8  
•  Parity: Even (2)
•  Stop bits: 1 (0)
•  Flow control: None (0)
•  Timeout: 3000ms

This detailed logging is extremely valuable for:
•  Debugging communication issues
•  Understanding the protocol  
•  Developing custom dive computer software
•  Analyzing data transfer patterns

You now have a complete log of every byte sent to and received from your Mares Puck Pro dive computer! This could be useful for reverse engineering the protocol or troubleshooting communication problems.
